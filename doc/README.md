amaterasu
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[amaterasu](https://www.amaterasuproject.org/amaterasu-wallets/) is the original amaterasu client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of amaterasu transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from one to two hours. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run amaterasu on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run in terminal:

- ./amaterasu-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or ./amaterasud (headless, 32-bit)
- ./amaterasu-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or ./amaterasud (headless, 64-bit)

### Windows

Run the installer, and then run amaterasu-qt.exe.

### OSX

Drag amaterasu-Qt to your applications folder, and then run amaterasu-Qt.
